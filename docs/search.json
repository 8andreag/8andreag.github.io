    "text": "Motivation and Context\nFor my project I wanted to explore if different kinds of environments/backgrounds that children have has an effect on how well a student performs in school. This is something I think is worth researching not just because I believe education is important but because it is a little personal. I find this topic interesting because I love learning but I didn’t always love learning in school when I was younger. If you had asked elementary me if I liked school I would’ve said no but I love school now don’t want to stop learning and I would like to for more people to be motivated to learn.\nI feel that I did not have the best relationship with school and it was for a reason. I believe that by studying the factors that influence student performance, we can gain insights into why some students excel while others struggle, ultimately helping to improve the education system. One question that has always lingered in my mind, but that I’ve never formally researched, is how a person’s upbringing affects their perspective on and performance in education. I think about this quite often because I worked at a school as a math tutor with elementary and middle school students, particularly with the students who were struggling academically, had behavioral challenges, or lacked motivation. Many of these students would only engage in learning when they were pulled out of the classroom for one-on-one instruction. And from this experience I was learning that a student’s academic struggles often have deeper roots, some had difficult home lives, some simply needed individual attention, some had parents who worked long hours and couldn’t help with homework, some had parents who weren’t able to help from a lack of completing school themselves, and, unfortunately, some had parents who didn’t prioritize education, which in turn influenced the student’s attitude toward school.\nThis issue is not just something I observed in others but it also something I can relate to from my own experiences. Coming from a family with parents who are not educated, I had a difficult time in elementary school and often felt disengaged. Even now, as a first-generation college student, I have, at times, felt discouraged, incapable, embarrassed, or unqualified, a lot of the reasons for these feelings are because of my background as a first-gen, female, minority student. But my personal experience in school growing up has instilled my current perspective and motivated me on being educated. I used to despise school in elementary, but I am now grateful to have an opportunity to go to college and become educated. Beyond my personal connection, I believe many others would find this topic relevant because education shapes the future. Understanding the factors behind academic success or failure, especially across different demographics, can help educators, policymakers, and communities better support students and create a more equitable learning environment. The younger generations are our future."

Specifically, I am interested in exploring how a student’s demographics, parental education, study habits, and family support and environment contribute to their success or struggles in school. What separates a high-performing student from one who is underperforming? By analyzing these variables, I aim to identify meaningful patterns and relationships that can inform how we better support students in diverse educational settings.\n\\(\\textbf{In short:}\\) What are the key determinants of student performance in school?"

    "text": "Data Description\nThe dataset used in this project is the Portuguese Student Performance Data Set, available through education datasets on Kaggle and sourced from two secondary schools in Portugal. The data was collected by researchers in 2005 and 2006 through surveys to analyze factors that influence student achievement, study patterns in student success, and explore the impact of socioeconomic and on learning outcomes in math and Portuguese language courses. It includes data on 649 students and captures a wide range of features such as demographics (age, sex, and address), family background (parental education and job), school support (extra tutoring, access to internet, travel time), personal habits (study time, free time, alcohol consumption), and academic performance across three grading periods: G1 (first trimester), G2 (second trimester), and G3 (final grade). This dataset provides a good foundation for analyzing how various personal and environmental factors influence academic outcomes.\nTo understand my analysis, it’s also important to have some background knowledge about education systems, student performance metrics, and social factors that influence learning. In Portugal, and for this data in particular the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd trimester), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd trimester grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G1 and G2. \\(\\textbf{Grades are typically on a 0–20 scale, with 10 as the minimum passing mark.}\\) \\(\\textbf{Compared to here in the U.S. high school years are generally sectioned}\\) \\(\\textbf{into semesters and students receive letter grades A, B, C, D, or F.}\\)\nStudent performance refers to how well a student meets academic benchmarks, typically measured through grades. Performance can be influenced by various factors, including socioeconomic background, parental involvement, and individual learning styles.\nSocioeconomic background referes to an individual’s or family’s economic and social position relative to others, based on factors like income, education level, and occupation. Socioeconomic factors and parental education levels may have different impacts due to cultural and systemic differences.\n\ndata &lt;- readr::read_csv(here::here(\"student-por.csv\"))\ndata\n\n# A tibble: 649 × 33\n   school sex     age address famsize Pstatus  Medu  Fedu Mjob     Fjob   reason\n   &lt;chr&gt;

For example, self-reported study habits and parental involvement may not always be accurate because students or parents might overestimate or underestimate their efforts. Additionally, this data was collected from specific schools in a different country, which means the findings might not be generalizable to all student populations around the world or even here in the US.\nSecond, is the mismatch between dataset variables and real-world educational experiences. For example, final grades may not reflect a student’s true learning abilities or potential, as they can be having a difficult school year or does poorly on exams or doesn’t do work for their grade.\nThird, geographic limitations could impact the model’s applicability. This data was collected in one country with one educational system that may not accurately reflect student performance in other areas due to cultural, economic, and policy differences.\nFinally, and importantly, there are ethical limitations to using statistical models to predict or describe student performance. While such models can help identify students in need of support, they also risk reinforcing stereotypes or lowering expectations. For example, if a model predicts that students from working-class or less-educated families are likely to underperform, it could lead to those students being tracked into less rigorous programs or receiving less encouragement.\nThis means that conclusions from my analysis may not be universally applicable and should be interpreted with these constraints in mind."

It appears that in this dataset there are 319 students who do receive academic support form their family, more than students who do not, 200. This will help us understand the balance in the dataset and whether family support plays a role in student performance.\nNaturally, I thought the next step should be to visualize and compare the tendency and spread of this variable across G1 G2 and G3 to see if family support results in better academic performance.\n\nstudent_G123 &lt;- student_train |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(G1, G2, G3), \n               names_to = \"Term\", \n               values_to = \"Grade\")\n\n\nggplot(student_G123, \n       mapping = aes(\n         x = famsup, \n         y = Grade, \n         fill = famsup\n         )\n       ) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Term) +  \n  labs(title = \"Grade Distribution by Family Support Across Terms\",\n       x = \"Family Support\",\n       y = \"Grade\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeans_by_group &lt;- student_G123 |&gt;\n  group_by(Term, famsup) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_grade = mean(Grade, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\nmeans_by_group\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Term  famsup mean_grade\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 G1    no           11.4\n2 G1    yes          11.6\n3 G2    no           11.5\n4 G2    yes          11.8\n5 G3    no           11.7\n6 G3    yes          12.3\n\n\nBased on the boxplots, there does not seem to be a significant difference in academic achievement based on whether or not a student receives academic support from their family. The mean for G1 grades in group no is 11.4 and the mean in group yes is 11.6. The mean is higher for the yes group but this may be due to the fact that there are more students who have family support than those who don’t. The means are fairly close. The mean for G2 grades in group no is 11.5 and the mean in group yes is 11.8. The mean is higher for the yes group. The means for G2 grades are also fairly close. The same can be said about grades for G3 grades. The mean for G3 grades in group no is 11.7 and the mean in group yes is 12.3.\nI also created a bar graph for more visual evidence. They seem very similar to each other.

My initial assumption without exploring the data is that the higher the education that parents received the more likely the student will follow in their footsteps and have better chances of academic success.\n\nstudent_train |&gt;\n  group_by(Fedu) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_G3 = mean(G3, na.rm = TRUE),\n            count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n   Fedu mean_G3 count\n  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     0    13       4\n2     1    11.2   136\n3     2    11.8   171\n4     3    12.7   102\n5     4    12.9   106\n\nggplot(data = student_G123, \n       mapping = aes(\n         x = Fedu,\n         fill = famsup\n         )\n       ) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Father's Education\", x = \"Education Level\", y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstudent_train |&gt;\n  group_by(Medu) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_G3 = mean(G3, na.rm = TRUE),\n            count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n   Medu mean_G3 count\n  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     0    11       5\n2     1    11.1   112\n3     2    11.7   152\n4     3    12.0   107\n5     4    13.2   143\n\nggplot(data = student_G123, \n       mapping = aes(\n         x = Medu,\n         fill = famsup)\n       ) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Mother's Education\", x = \"Education Level\", y = \"Count\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean final grade (G3) for each level of Fedu:\n\n0 (no education): average final grade is 13\n1 (primary education up to 4th grade): average final grade is 11.2\n2 (primary education 5th to 9th grade): average final grade is 11.8\n3 (secondary education 10th to 12th): average final grade is 12.7\n\n*4 (higher education): average final grade is 12.9\nThe first summary reveals that final grades tend to increas as the fathers level of education increases.\nThe mean final grade (G3) for each level of Medu:\n\n0 (no education): average final grade is 11\n1 (primary education up to 4th grade): average final grade is 11.1\n2 (primary education 5th to 9th grade): average final grade is 11.7\n3 (secondary education 10th to 12th): average final grade is 12\n4 (higher education): average final grade is 13.2\n\nThe second summary reveals that final grades also tend to increase as the mothers level of education increases but it is not as high as the average final grades when the father is educated.\nThere does seem to be a pattern so next I wanted to determine whether students with more educated parents perform better or if one parent in particular that is educated has a greater effect than the other.\n\nggplot(student_G123, \n       mapping = aes(\n         x = Fedu, \n         y = Grade,\n         color = famsup\n         )\n       ) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Term) + \n  labs(title = \"Father's Education vs. Final Grades\",\n       x = \"Father's Education Level\",\n       y = \"Final Grades\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(student_G123, \n       mapping = aes(\n         x = Medu, \n         y = Grade,\n         color = famsup\n         )\n       ) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Term) + \n  labs(title = \"Mother's Education vs. Final Grades\",\n       x = \"Mother's Education Level\",\n       y = \"Final Grades\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plots help visualize the relationships between each parents educational level and the students academic success. There is a positive relationship between each variable. As the parents educational level increases, for both the mother and father, the student does achieve higher grades. Though it is hard to notice the line for the fathers education is slightly higher in comparison to the mothers education line. So at every level for fathers education the average final grades are higher than it is for mothers at the same levels of education. The fathers education correlates to the students grades and has a greater impact on their grades than the mother being educated.\nAnother variable that I wanted to take a look at was study time.

There are a lot of variables and we want to get the most out of our data without it being overly complicated, PCA reduces dimensions by identifying principal components that explain the most variance in the data. It helps reveal underlying patterns while simplifying the feature space. I also want to know what patterns exist within the data, clustering groups similar observations together based on selected features. It helps explore whether certain student profiles naturally emerge and whether those profiles relate to academic performance or support structures.\n\\(\\textbf{Principal Component Analysis}\\)\nBefore we fit the models, we must:\nRemove non-numeric variables and or convert categorical variables into numeric. Then we scale/standardize the numeric variables so that they contribute equally to distance calculations.\n\n# Create a recipe for preprocessing\nstudent_pca_recipe &lt;- recipe(G3 ~ ., data = student_train) |&gt;\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) |&gt;\n  step_center(all_numeric_predictors()) |&gt;\n  step_scale(all_numeric_predictors())\n\n\\(\\textbf{Why this matters for PCA}\\)\nPCA is very sensitive to scale. Variables with higher variances will dominate the principal components unless the data is standardized.

The summary shows us standard deviation, proportion of variance, and cumulative proportion of each component which can also help with determining how many components to keep.\nLooking at the scree plots and the summary combined, we would reduce dimensionality while also preserving as much meaningful information as possible by keeping 7 components to explain about at least 80% of the variance. Which is good and bad. Good because we significantly reduced the number of dimensions, from 12 variables to just 7 while still capturing a lot of variance, bad because this many components is difficult to interpret.\nWhile the first 7 principal components explain about 87% of the variance in the dataset, I chose to proceed with just the first 2 principal components. This decision is motivated by the goal of exploratory analysis and visualization. Using 2 components allows for interpretable, two-dimensional plots, such as biplots and cluster visualizations, that reveal broad patterns and relationships between variables and student groups.\nAlthough only a smaller portion of the total variance is retained, about 39%, these first two components still capture the most dominant axes of variation in the data. They are particularly useful for uncovering meaningful group structure and identifying how key variables relate to one another in reduced space. The trade-off is that this level of reduction sacrifices some detail but it significantly enhances interpretability and visual insight, which is appropriate given the objectives of this part of the analysis.\nTo visualize the relationship between these variables and observations in a 2D biplot we obtain the following:\n\nset.seed(123)\nbiplot(student_pca_model,\n       scale = 0,\n       cex = 0.9, # Shrinks text size\n       main = \"Biplot of Student PCA\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make this slightly more interpretable by thinning the amount of observations we allow in the biplot.\n\nrownames(student_pca_model$x) &lt;- rownames(student_pca_baked)\nrandom_rows &lt;- sample(nrow(student_pca_model$x), 100) #100 obervations\n\nbiplot(\n  x = student_pca_model$x[random_rows,],\n  y = student_pca_model$rotation\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally I think it would take an extra step to really see what each component represents.\n\nloadings &lt;- as.data.frame(student_pca_model$rotation[, 1:2])\nloadings$var &lt;- rownames(loadings)\n\nggplot(loadings, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, label = var)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = PC1, yend = PC2), \n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\")), color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_text(vjust = 1.2, size = 1.95) +\n  xlim(-1, 1) + ylim(-1, 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Variable Loadings on PC1 and PC2\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, there are only two components: PC1 (horizontal axis) and PC2 (vertical axis). Second, the numbers (-1.0 to 1.0) represent standardized scores, recall that they are scaled, so each axis is measured in standard deviation units. Third, each arrow on the plot represents a variable (feature) from the dataset and are positioned in this new 2D space based on how much it contributes to or aligns with these components. The direction shows how strongly that variable is aligned with each principal component. Arrows pointing to the right contribute more to PC1. Similaryly, arrows pointing up contribute more to PC2. Their lengths represent their importance. The longer the arrow, the more important that variable is in shaping the component. Shorter arrows mean the variable has less influence on PC1 and PC2. With this knowlege we can no interpret the biplot.\nBased on the biplot, PC1 appears to represent academic performance and parental education. Variables like Fedu, Medu, G1, and G2 load strongly to the right, suggesting that students with more educated parents tend to earn better grades.\n\nHigher PC1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) stronger academic performance and more educated parents\nLower PC1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) weaker grades, possibly less academic support at home\n\nPC2 seems to capture student student independence, instability, or reduced traditional support. Variables like guardian_other, Pstatus_T, and studytime_X3, load strongly pointing downward, suggesting that students these students might correspond to more non-traditional guardianship (like not living with both parents).\n\nHigher PC2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) possibly more instability or nontraditional support\nLower PC2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) more consistent support structures, potentially more engaged guardians\n\nTogether, these components suggest that students’ final grades (G3) are shaped not only by family educational background but also by their home environment and education support.\n\\[\\text{PC1} = 0.4094\\times(Fedu) + 0.4372\\times(Medu) + 0.5262\\times(G1) + 0.5271\\times(G2) - 0.052\\times(Pstatus = T) + 0.0427\\times(guardian = mother) - 0.1491\\times(guardian = other) + 0.0013\\times(studytime = X2) + 0.1817\\times(studytime = X3) + 0.0870\\times(studytime = X4) + 0.1384\\times(famsup = yes)\\]\n\\(\\text{PC2} = - 0.1995\\times(Fedu) - 0.2228\\times(Medu) + 0.1501\\times(G1) + 0.1686\\times(G2) + 0.2605\\times(Pstatus = T) - 0.3441\\times(guardian = mother) + 0.3256\\times(guardian = other) - 0.5552\\times(studytime = X2) + 0.4240\\times(studytime = X3) + 0.2687\\times(studytime = X4) - 0.0839\\times(famsup = yes)\\)\nThis equation shows how PC1 and PC2 are computed as a linear combinations of the original variables, each weighted by a coefficient (loading).\nThe larger the absolute value of a coefficient, the more that variable contributes to eac principal component.The sign (positive/negative) tells you the direction of that influence.\n\n#categorizing\nstudent_multinom_data &lt;- student_train |&gt;\n  mutate(G3_category = case_when(\n    G3 &lt; 10 ~ \"low\",         # Failing or poor performance\n    G3 &gt;= 10 & G3 &lt; 15 ~ \"medium\",  # Average performance\n    G3 &gt;= 15 ~ \"high\"        # High-performing students\n  ))\n\n\npca_scores &lt;- as.data.frame(student_pca_model$x[, 1:2])  # PC1 and PC2\npca_scores$G3_category &lt;- student_multinom_data$G3_category\n\n\nlibrary(nnet)\n\n# Make sure G3_category is a factor\npca_scores$G3_category &lt;- as.factor(pca_scores$G3_category)\n\n# Fit the model using PC1 and PC2 as predictors\nmultinom_model &lt;- multinom(G3_category ~ PC1 + PC2, data = pca_scores)\n\n# weights:  12 (6 variable)\ninitial  value 570.179778 \niter  10 value 278.623878\nfinal  value 278.487428 \nconverged\n\nsummary(multinom_model)\n\nCall:\nmultinom(formula = G3_category ~ PC1 + PC2, data = pca_scores)\n\nCoefficients:\n       (Intercept)       PC1        PC2\nlow      -1.084983 -3.083302 -1.0495486\nmedium    2.353355 -1.496623 -0.2717676\n\nStd.

A model might view someone like me as unlikely to succeed — but that prediction would miss personal motivation, resilience, and other unmeasured qualities. It raises the question: is a student “underperforming,” or is the model failing to capture their full potential? Predictive models must be used carefully, with awareness of both their value and their limitations, especially in high-stakes educational decisions.\n\nLimitations and Future Work\n\n\nReflection (Optional Subsection)"
